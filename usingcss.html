          Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the 
          presentation and styling a document written in markup language such as HTML.
          It was developed by World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) around 27 years ago.
          It is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,including 
          layout,colors, and fonts.Separation of formatting and content also makes it 
          feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different 
          rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
           or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for 
           alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which 
          declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular
           element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
