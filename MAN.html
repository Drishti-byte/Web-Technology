It provides high-speed data communication services such as video, audio, and data transfer between multiple LANs (Local Area Networks) and WANs (Wide Area Networks). The main purpose of a MAN is to connect different LANs in a city to share resources and exchange data, as well as to provide internet access to users. A MAN typically covers a geographic area of several kilometers and is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.</FONT></P><BR>
