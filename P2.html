<P><FONT FACE="MONOTYPE CORSIVA" COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="5"> First-generation computers, which 
    were created between the 1940s and 1950s, represented the start of the computers. These 
    computers employed vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for storage. First 
    Generation Computers were too bulky and large that they needed a full room and consumed a 
    lot of electricity.The technology behind the first-generation computers was a fragile 
    glass device, which was called a vacuum tube. These computers were very heavy and really 
    large. They are not reliable, programming on them was a tedious task as they used 
    low-level programming language and used no Operating System. First-generation computers 
    were used for calculation, storage, and control purposes. Punch cards were used to 
    improve the information for external storage.</FONT></P><BR>

<IMG SRC="C:\Users\sumit bansal\Desktop\Second generation.jfif"><BR>
<P><FONT FACE="MONOTYPE CORSIVA" COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="5">The period of second generation was 
    from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed 
    less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation 
    machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the 
    primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices.The 
    second generation computers were used during 1957-1963. They are also known as 
    transistor computers. The second generation of computers consists of two types of devices, 
    transistors, and magnetic core. The transistors helped to develop a better computer than 
    the first generation computers consisting of vacuum tubes. Some second generation of 
    computers are IBM 1920, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, IBM 1401, etc.</FONT></P><BR>

<IMG SRC="C:\Users\sumit bansal\Desktop\Third geneartion.jpg" HEIGHT="200" WIDTH="200"><BR>
<P><FONT FACE="MONOTYPE CORSIVA" COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="5">The third generation computer was 
    started in 1965 and ended around 1971. Third generation computers start using integrated 
    circuits instead of transistors. The integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor material, 
    that contains thousands of transistors miniaturized in it. With the help of IC, the 
    computer becomes more reliable, fast, required less maintenance, small in size, generates 
    less heat, and is less expensive. It was developed by Robert Noyce of Fairchild 
    Semiconductor and Jack Kilby (American electrical engineer) of Texas Instruments in 1958. 
    So due to ICs, the third generation computers are much faster, efficient, reliable, less 
    maintenance, and small in size as compared to first and second generation computers. 
    Third generation computer uses less electricity but still, they are little expensive and 
    also use the air conditioner for cooling.The third generation computers reduce the 
    computational time.</FONT></P><BR>
<FONT COLOR="ORANGE" SIZE="7">FOURTH GENERATION </FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC="C:\Users\sumit bansal\Desktop\Fourth generation.jpg"><BR>
<P><FONT FACE="MONOTYPE CORSIVA" COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="5">The period of fourth generation was 
    from 1971-1980. Computers of fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) 
    circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with 
    their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of 
    fourth generation.Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable, 
    and affordable. As a result, it gave rise to Personal Computer (PC) revolution. In this 
    generation, time sharing, real time networks, distributed operating system were used. 
    All the high-level languages like C, C++, DBASE etc., were used in this generation.

<FONT COLOR="ORANGE" SIZE="7">FIFTH GENERATION </FONT><BR>
<IMG SRC="C:\Users\sumit bansal\Desktop\Fifth generation.png">
<P><FONT FACE="MONOTYPE CORSIVA" COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="5">Fifth-generation computers, also known 
    as modern computers, are still in the development stage and are based on artificial 
    intelligence.This is the most recent and technologically advanced computer generation. 
    Modern high-level languages such as Python, R, C#, Java, and others are used as input 
    methods. These are incredibly dependable and use the Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI) 
    technology.In the fifth generation of computers, all high-level languages are employed. 
    The primary goal of the fifth generation is to create machines that can learn and organize
    themselves. Artificial intelligence and parallel processing hardware are at the heart of 
    this generation of computers, and artificial intelligence encompasses terms like Robotics, 
    Neural Networks, etc.
