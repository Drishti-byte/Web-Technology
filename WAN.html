<P><FONT FACE="MONOTYPE CORSIVA" COLOR="CYAN" SIZE="5">A wide area network (WAN) is a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances. WANs are often used by large businesses to connect their office networks; each office typically has its own local area network, or LAN, and these LANs connect via a WAN. These long connections may be formed in several different ways, including leased lines, VPNs, or IP tunnel.</FONT></P><BR>
